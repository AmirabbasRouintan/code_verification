# Code Verification
This is a Python script that sends an HTML-based email with a verification code to a user's email address.

## Features
***Send Emails***: The script uses the `smtplib` library to send emails to users.
***Generate Random Codes***: The script generates random codes for each user and includes them in the email message.
***Verify User Input***: The script prompts users to enter their verification code, and verifies that it matches the randomly generated code.

## How It Works
1. ***Get User Input***: The script asks the user to input their name and email address.
2. ***Generate Random Code***: The script generates a random code for the user.
3. ***Send Email***: The script sends an email to the user with the random code included in the message.
4. ***Verify User Input***: The script prompts the user to enter their verification code, and verifies that it matches the randomly generated code.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
